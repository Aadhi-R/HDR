# HDR
Handwritten Digit Recognition using Faster R-CNN

1.For HDR, a speedier, more specific deep learning model has been implemented using the existing modules present in python. 

2.Customized Faster Regional Convolutional Neural Network is the name of the model (Faster-RCNN). 
  2.1 The region of interest is first determined by doing annotation insertion. 
  2.2 The deep features are then computed using the Faster-RCNN, which introduces DenseNet-41. 
  2.3 The digits are then localised and divided into ten classes using the regressor and classification layer (0-9). 
3.The MNIST dataset was used in this study.
